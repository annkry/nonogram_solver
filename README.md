# nonogram_solver
In this repository, a program will solve nonogram with original rules. The program will take as input a description of a logical image and output the corresponding image. The logical image is described by a set of rules that specify the color of each cell in the image based on its neighboring cells. The program will generate the image by applying these rules iteratively until a stable configuration is reached. In this program, I will be using dynamic programming.

Input file: zad_input.txt
Output file: zad_output.txt

To run all 12 tests: python validator.py zad1 python main.py
